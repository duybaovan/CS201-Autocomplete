Problem 1: What is the order of growth (big-Oh) of the number of compares
(in the worst case) that each of the operations in the Autocomplete data
type make, as a function of the number of terms N, the number of matching
terms M, and k, the number of matches returned by topKMatches for
BinarySearchAutocomplete?

Problem 2: How does the runtime of topKMatches() vary with k, assuming a fixed prefix
and set of terms? 
2A BruteAutocomplete:
2B BinarySearchAutocomplete:
2C TrieAutocomplete:

Problem 3: Look at the methods topMatch and topKMatches in BruteAutocomplete and
BinarySearchAutocomplete and compare both their theoretical and empirical
runtimes. Is BinarySearchAutocomplete always guaranteed to perform better
than BruteAutocomplete? Justify your answer.

Problem 4: For all three of the Autocompletor implementations, how does increasing the
size of the source and increasing the size of the prefix argument affect
the runtime of topMatch and topKMatches?

4B BinarySearchAutocomplete:
4C TrieAutocomplete:
